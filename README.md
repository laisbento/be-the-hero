This repository was created for me to study Full Stack Development using Node.js and React during a bootcamp offered by Rocketseat.

During the bootcamp, I developed a small application with basic CRUD operations using SQLite3 as database and Axios to communicate with the backend.

## How to Run
### Backend
1. Clone the repository
2. Access the **`backend`** directory
3. Install dependencies with **`npm install`**
4. Run the application with **`npm start`**
5. The backend will be running on **`http://localhost:3333.`**

Frontend
1. Access the frontend directory
2. Install dependencies with **`npm install`**
3. Run the application with **`npm start`**
4. The backend will be running on **`http://localhost:3000.`**

## Technologies
### Backend
* Node.js
* Express
* SQLite3
* Knex (Query Builder)
* Cors
* Nodemon (dev dependency)

### Frontend
* React
* React Router
* Axios
* React Icons

## Scripts
### Backend
**`start`** - starts the application using nodemon **`src/index.js`**

### Frontend
**`start`** - starts the application using **`react-scripts start`**

**`build`** - builds the application for production using **`react-scripts build`**

**`test`** - runs tests using **`react-scripts test`**

**`eject`** - ejects the application from Create React App using **`react-scripts eject`**

Feel free to check it out and give me feedback!
